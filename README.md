## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HotelReservationSystem.git


## Set up PostgreSQL database

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    reservation_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    guest_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    room_number INT NOT NULL,
    contact_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    reservation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
## Update database connection in Java

```java
String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database";
String user = "your_username";
String password = "your_password";
```
## Notes

- Room numbers must be numeric.  
- Guest name and contact number can include spaces.  
- The system uses **PreparedStatement** to prevent SQL injection.  
- Reservation ID is auto-generated by the database.
